# Tilt-Detection
Increasing loads acting on a wind turbine foundation increases the risk of sudden downtime and damages to the power infrastructure. The system used for wind turbine tilt monitoring costs about $2400, making traditional structural health monitoring systems costly to implement and thus are not always done.

The objective of the project was to design and test a low-cost wireless node prototype to monitor the tilt a wind turbine foundation experiences over time. The system would benefit turbine manufacturers by providing a low-cost alternative to current expensive systems. Remotely monitoring wind turbines would reduce costs associated with repairs and turbine downtime. The prototype would act as a single node within a larger network of nodes to monitor wind turbine farms.
